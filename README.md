# Crime-Data-Analysis
This project aims to analyze crime data from the city of Los Angeles to gain a deeper understanding of the patterns and trends of criminal activity in the area. 
By using data visualization and statistical analysis techniques, we hope to identify hotspots of crime, potential predictors of crime activity, and potential strategies for crime prevention and reduction.
